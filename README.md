## Setup

**Install Node.js,NPM and Playwright**

Install NPM on your local machine. Here's the [instruction](https://nodejs.org/en/download) for installation of Node.js and NPM. 
Validate successful installation of Node.js Packet Manager version 
```shell
npm version
```
Install NPX on your local machine. Here's the [instruction](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) for installation of NPX. 
Validate successful installation of NPX. 
```shell
npx -v
```

Open the root folder of the project in a console and run the next command.
```shell
npm i
```
```shell
npx playwright install
```

**Add your user to data file**

To be able to execute tests you should add your user credentials to `tests\data\login-data.json` file. Please remember to remove your credentials before pushing to this repository! Or you can add this file to `.gitignore` to avoid any security issues.

### Run tests in UI mode

Chrome browser is used for the test execution. Other browsers could be added by changing the `playwright.config.ts` file.

To open tests on your machine run command from `scylla-db-cloud-playwright` directory.
```shell
npx playwright test --ui    
```
Upon successful completion of this command, the Playwright window launches. You can run each test file one by one by clicking on the file name in the Playwright window or just click the "Run all specs" button.

### Run tests in terminal

To open tests on your machine run command from `scylla-db-cloud-playwright` directory.
```shell
npx playwright test --reporter=html
```
Upon successful completion of this command, you can open the HTM report by running command:
```shell
npx playwright show-report
```
You can run tests and see results directly in your console by running the next command:
```shell
npx playwright test --reporter=list
```

### Adding tests

**Page objects**

All locators and methods for particular pages or components are stored in `tests\pages` following the [Page Object models Patern](https://playwright.dev/docs/pom). 

**Fixtures**

Furthermore, the framework Playwright Test is based on the concept of [test fixtures](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures). Test fixtures are used to establish environment for each test, giving the test everything it needs and nothing else. Test fixtures are isolated between tests. To add a new fixture to the framework use `fixtures\fixture` folder. `apiStorageStateFixture` is used for loggin user into the system using the API calls.

**Data**

You can save the data needed for the tests inside `tests\data` folder. The example of such approach could be viewed in `tests\data\clusterRegionAndPrice.ts` and `tests\specs\newCluster.spec.ts`files. It allows us to easialy change the data without changing the existing tests files.

**Tests**

Tests should be added to the `tests\specs` folder with appropriate name `tests\specs\${testName}.spec.ts`.
